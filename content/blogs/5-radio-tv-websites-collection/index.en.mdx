### Lightyear.fm: Time Travel Radio

##### https://www.lightyear.fm/

Lightyear.fm is a radio website filled with poetry and science fiction. Its concept is based on an interesting physics principle: light years. The website lets you select positions at different light-year distances from Earth, then plays radio programs from corresponding years. For example, if you choose a location 40 light-years from Earth, you'll hear radio content from 40 years ago, as if those radio waves just reached that distance. This creative concept perfectly combines time, space, and audio, serving not just as a nostalgia tool but as a philosophical experience that makes you contemplate space-time concepts. Through this website, you can "travel back in time" to listen to music, news, and culture from different eras, feeling the passage of time.
