Hello everyone, I'm Cayden. This year I've started to pick up independent development again, continuing my journey as an independent developer. I previously developed a [Time Mileage Mini Program](/post/1be3071d.html), which has about 100-300 daily visitors. Although the user base is small, the user engagement is quite high. It has been running for many years without much maintenance, yet still maintains traffic.

This year I started a new project called [W3Cay](http://w3cay.com). As the name suggests, this website is definitely related to fun and interesting content.

### Website Introduction

![](/images/w3cay-funny-website/cover.jpg)

This website is mainly used to share interesting independent websites, mini-games, tools, and AI-related applications. The data comes from my own collection and user submissions. It has been online for 3 months now, with hundreds of interesting applications recorded, and new sites are added weekly. All the website entries are personally visited, screened, and written by me, with AI assistance for content polishing. It's quite time-consuming overall.

However, it's gratifying to see that many users are now accessing the site through search engines, and watching the growth in traffic data is very encouraging. Welcome everyone to visit!

### Why I Developed This Website

Although I had seen similar products before creating this website, I still wanted to maintain my own unique site because without doing this, I felt like something was missing.

When I was young, my parents subscribed to newspapers, and I really liked the funny entertainment section called "Humor Zone" - basically memes and interesting pictures. But it was just for a quick laugh, and then the newspaper would be bundled up and sold as scrap paper. I thought it was a shame that so many interesting materials would be lost, and I wouldn't be able to see them again in the future.

So I wanted to cut out these funny newspaper pictures or text materials and collect them in my password book using double-sided tape. I would share my password book with my little playmates so they could also see them, and I really enjoyed the pleasure of sharing these "achievements."

During college, because I studied computer science, I followed some UED design and programming news, and occasionally would see some cool websites. Every time I saw them, I would collect the websites like treasures, thinking that if only I could create these creative websites. Later, after graduating from college and starting to work as a programmer, in the day-to-day work routine, I gradually forgot about this hobby of collecting, and lost interest in websites.

Today, after working for many years, I suddenly felt that I should pick this up again - to have my own interesting website, collect interesting and creative content, and then share it. This is what I want to do.

### Website Goals

The website will maintain regular updates, and as my site name suggests, the goal is to collect ten thousand interesting websites. We're still far from that goal.

What makes this website different from other similar sites is that I will also develop some of my own interesting small tools or web pages.

Because when I was collecting interesting websites, I found that there are really too few interesting and creative websites in China - most are from abroad. For domestic users, first, due to the firewall, you need to use a VPN to access them, and second, even if you can access them, the web pages are in foreign languages, and not everyone's English is good, so the experience is greatly diminished.

So I will periodically share some of my own creative small products on my W3Cay website, tagged as [W3Cay Original](https://w3cay.com/tags/w3cay-original/).

### Finally

Welcome everyone to visit my W3Cay website regularly, and welcome everyone to submit content and share your interesting small works. May this world be full of fun and laughter!
