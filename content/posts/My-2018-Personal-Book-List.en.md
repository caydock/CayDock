Since I bought a Kindle during the 2018 Spring Festival, I've really read many more books, and of course it has also improved my sleep. I even regret not getting one earlier. 2018 has passed for a few days now, so let me organize some of the books I read last year and make a review and archive.

## "Advancement: How to Become a Very Capable Person"

This book explores themes of self-improvement including time, action, and thinking.

My main excerpts:

> How a person treats their time determines what kind of person they can become

> When analyzing whether something is worth doing and how much energy to invest, we can evaluate from two perspectives: first, the size of the benefit this thing will bring to "me" in the present, this benefit can be mental, emotional, physical, or material - I call this "benefit value"; second, the speed at which this benefit decays over time, I call this "benefit half-life." Events with long half-lives will have lasting impact

> The time actually spent doing things is always longer than expected, even when expectations consider Hofstadter's Law

> Starting from theory doesn't necessarily guide practice; only knowledge accumulated through reflection in practice can guide practice

> Don't just be an information porter. Through decoding, delve deep into things
