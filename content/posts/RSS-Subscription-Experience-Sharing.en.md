> RSS (English full name: RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication), Chinese translation: Simple Information Aggregation, also known as aggregated content, is a message source format specification used to aggregate content updates from multiple websites and automatically notify website subscribers. After using RSS, website subscribers no longer need to manually check whether websites have new content. At the same time, RSS can integrate content updates from multiple websites and present them in summary form, helping subscribers quickly obtain important information and selectively click to view.

## Why I Started Using RSS Subscriptions Again

After using Weibo for about ten years and then switching to Toutiao, I finally changed my information acquisition tool to RSS.

Weibo's slogan is "Discover fresh things anytime, anywhere." Its advantage is that information acquisition is very timely, and it's also the main venue for public opinion outbreaks. However, its disadvantages are also very obvious: information is mixed with good and bad, comments are full of hostility, opposing opinions make people feel confused, and the entire comment section is like a Rashomon.

Later, I felt that Weibo had nothing worth watching, especially the hot searches were so boring that every move of celebrities would make it to the hot search. So I uninstalled Weibo and switched to Toutiao.

Toutiao's characteristic is recommending content you want to see based on your preferences. This actually has both advantages and disadvantages. The good thing is that you don't need to waste time filtering content you want to see. The bad thing is that such recommendation algorithms make you completely become a frog in a well of information. I followed some financial bloggers and news media on Toutiao. After browsing for a while, I found that most of Toutiao's information content is relatively shallow breaking news, without much in-depth content. Or maybe my way of following was wrong. In short, there's a lot of information, but I don't want to stay for too long.

I've used RSS intermittently for a long time during work, but in the end, I basically gave up for a while because the tools were not easy to use, such as being blocked by the wall, poor experience, or too complex functionality. At the beginning of 2022, after weighing the pros and cons, I felt that RSS was more suitable for me. The most important thing is that I can subscribe to some technical weeklies or blogs. Previously, aimlessly browsing Toutiao and Weibo caused me to pay much less attention to technology, and I could no longer keep up with the community's pace, which I felt was very regrettable.

Although RSS subscription is now considered an "antique," many websites or blogs have stopped providing services. However, there are still a few websites with good content that continue to provide services, and you can still combine subscriptions to create a good information flow. So at the beginning of 2022, I decided to start using RSS again.
